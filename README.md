# Coffee Shop Queuing Simulation

Many of the popular coffee shops are striving to ensure a high level of customer satisfaction. One of the key measures that determine customer satisfaction is the time to fill a customerâ€™s order. This project tries to simulate a simple queuing system in a coffee shop to determine the optimal number of baristas and cashiers to minimise the wait time and maintain customer satisfaction.
